<h2>Features</h2>

The website is comprised of four pages, one of home page and contact us form is accessible from navigation menu lists and others forms can be accessible from buttons on  the main header section.The fourth page is a form submission confirmation page which is shown once a user submits the form on the contact us,all other three forms on other pages.

<br>

<h4>Home  Page</h4>

<li>When viewing with mobile devices the navigation links change to a burger toggler. This was implemented to give the site a clean look and to promote a good user experience, as users are used to seeing the burger icon when on mobile devices to navigate a site.

<h2>Accessibility</h2>

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is a User Friendly.

<li>Using semantic HTML.

Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.

<li>Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the review ratings for books & footer icons.

<li>Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

<li>Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

<h3>Future Implementations.</h3>

<li>Use javascript to perform return to top function on Website.

<li>A meet the members page - This would have a photo of the member together with a small bio. A link to their instagram and/or goodreads page.

<li>Competitions/giveaways page - This page would give further information/rules on the competitions and giveaways.
